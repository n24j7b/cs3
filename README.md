SQL Data Fundamentals and Business Intelligence 
Fall 2024 
Course Description: 
This course is designed for the Master of Business Analytics as a core   course. The   effective use   of   data across firms to deliver fast and intelligent services presents   a   critical   challenge   to   today’s   business leaders. This course is designed to introduce students to basic   concepts   and techniques in   the   theory, design, implementation   and   administration   of   relational   databases. Topics   to   be   covered   include, the database design process, MS Access, the Entity Relationship (ER) model, retrieval queries in Structured Query Language (SQL), distributed and client-server databases, and building a database   system   from   scratch. This course focuses   on the skills   and   concepts needed to   design   and   query   databases   and therefore contribute to companies’ competitive positions.
Course Goals: This course focuses on helping   students develop   database   design   and retrieval   skills needed to effectively work in a business environment. We will devote a   substantial   amount   of   time to   mastering technical database skills. The deeper issues surrounding   SQL must be   addressed through   a broad and conceptual approach. Hence, this course will provide a mix of   qualitative   and   quantitative treatments   of   the   subject   using   lectures, projects, assignments, and   exercises.
Student learning Objectives:
As   the   result   of   this   course, students   should   be   able   to:
1.       use relational database management systems;   work with   entity relationship   diagrams,
2.       create, access, read, manage,   and modify working   databases in   Access   and   SQL   Server,
3.       run advanced queries   for business intelligence   and   visualization.
Course Structure: 
We will cover   12 modules in Canvas - roughly one module per week.   There will   be   two   review   sessions. You have to complete reading assignments and watch the lecture videos before coming to class. Your attendance and participation are required and essential.

Grade Symbols: 
This   course   and   all   graduate   program   courses   in   the   Freeman   School   use   a   letter   grade   system   with   the   following quality   point equivalents:A = 4.00 C = 2.00 A- = 3.67 C- = 1.67 B+ = 3.33 D+ = 1.33 B = 3.00 D = 1.00 B- = 2.67 D- = 0.67 C+ = 2.33 F = 0.00 
The   quality   point   total   for   each   course   is   computed   by   multiplying   the   numerical   value   of   the   grade   received by the course credit hours.
Grading Guidelines: As approved by the Freeman School faculty, this course follows the recommended grading policy for a class   GPA by program.   6000-level   courses are expected to   have   a   mean   class   GPA   in   the   range   of 3.00 to   3.33   and   7000-level   courses   are   expected to have   a mean   class   GPA   in the   range   of 3.33   to   3.67.   All   sections   will be pooled into one list and one class   GPA will be   computed.
Team Assignments and Project: 
Skill-building exercises will be assigned throughout the semester. A team of   three will   submit   an assignment. The grade will be share代 写MGSC 7100 SQL Data Fundamentals and Business Intelligence Fall 2024R
代做程序编程语言d. Your submission is your team’s   submission. You’re   supposed to   work together. I will not mediate team disputes. I have a right   to   change team   structures.
•          Each assignment must be submitted on time. Late assignments will not be accepted. A   grade   of   zero will   be   assigned   if   you   do   not   turn   in   the   assignment.
•          Answers to assignment problems should be submitted though   Canvas under the Assignments folder. Please make sure that your submission is successful. No credit will be given to   unsuccessful   or incomplete submissions.
•          Although exchange of   ideas is encouraged,   don’t   forget that   there   are   some boundaries   not   to be crossed   that   are   defined   by   the   Tulane   Honor   Code. Examples   of   the   violations   of   the   Tulane   Honor Code include, but are not limited to,
1.       Handing in another team’s work   as your   own.   This   constitutes plagiarism.
2.       Providing your work for someone   else to hand   in   as their   own.   This   includes   e-mailing   your   file   to someone   just so they can   “see what you   did”   .
3.       Explicitly   telling   another   student   how   to   do   the   assignment   in   away   that   hinders   their   learning   of the material.
Additional Notes: 
•          Attendance   will   often   betaken. Be   on   time! No   disrupting   classmates, no   surfing   the   net, reading    news, updating profiles, ringing phones, or working on that assignment due in another course.   We   will   have   a   short   breakin   the   middle   of   every   class.
•          You need to create an SQL ecosystem in your machines. This course is designed for Windows PC’s.   An installation tutorial will be provided later in the class.
•          Running Windows in parallel or installing Docker for MAC almost always created some problems. No   help will be provided to the MAC users.
•          You must have your computer for   every   class. You will need to use SQL Server during the quizzes and assignments; you   maybe   asked   to   turn   in   your   SQL   scripts.
•          You will learn SQL by doing   cases/questions. Your   close   attention   in-class   is   essential.
•          The   course   content: quizzes, assignments,   and   the   project   will   make   you   ready   for   the   job   market. My recommendation for a successful completion is: study the module,   do   the   scripts,   try   to   create your own challenges, solve practice examples, watch video recordings, and ask questions.
Office Hours Policy: 
Office   hours   will   be   done   virtually   throughZoom. It   is   on   a   first-come   first   served   basis.   If   another student   (or   a   team) is   waiting   inline   after   6 minutes,   I   will   ask   you   to   go   to   the   end   of   the   queue.
Recording of Class Sessions: 
Sessions   will   not   be   recorded. No   Zoom   access   will   be   provided. If   you   miss   a   session, you   can   catchup through the contents in   Canvas.
