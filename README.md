PLA 4539: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS II 
FALL 2024 
COURSE DESCRIPTION 
The Development Process course sequence is an application-based approach to developing an idea for how a site should be developed, assessing feasibility of the initial concept, and revising the development program. 
Referencing the initial conceptualization work of Development Process I (completed in Summer 2024 Semester A), this sequel course is intended to drive home the iterative work necessary to align design development and ﬁnancial feasibility into a viable project. Students will draw from and apply technical concepts and learning outcomes from other core and elective courses in a coordinated way to develop a proposed project as their ﬁ nal deliverable. 
The coursework emphasizes students acquainting themselves with a speciﬁc development site, and by applying a new phase of the development process each week, will build an investment strategy for their site resulting in a deal book as a ﬁ nal course deliverable.
This course builds toward preparing students for the comprehensive understanding of the development process required for Capstone.
Readings and guest speakers will be introduced to provide additional context as appropriate.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS  EXPECTATIONS 
3.0 credits (core requirement) 
This is a required core course within the MSRED program curriculum. Successful completion of it is one of the minimum requirements for graduation. It is structured as a continuation of the Development Process I (completed in Summer2024  Semester A).  Completion of Development Process I is a prerequisite for enrollment in this course. 
Students will be expected to attend all scheduled classes in-person and to participate actively to the maximum extent possible, including actively engaging in weekly class discussions and with any guest speakers to demonstrate their grasp of concepts being discussed in class. In addition to discussion and reﬂection, class participation may include responding to polls, sharing completed assignments, breaking out into groups, or giving short presentations. 
The course structure will require students to review course materials and complete graded assignments as either outlined here on the syllabus or posted on Courseworks. Students should expect 6-8 hours of class-related work in addition to class time each week. 
In addition to the scheduled weekly lecture, students are expected to attend a regularly-scheduled lab for support in completing assignments and/or for furthering the understanding of lecture content.
Graded work must be completed and submitted on time.
There will be no ﬁ nal exam for this course but there will be a required individual development proposal deliverable.
LEARNING OUTCOMES 
De代 写PLA 4539: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS II FALL 2024R
代做程序编程语言velopment Process II is focused on deepening students’ understanding of the relationship among design, the market, regulatory constraints, stakeholders, and ﬁnancial tools in shaping the outcome of a proposed project. Concepts that students should be expected to understand by the end of the class include, among others: 
● land valuation 
● design development 
● back of the envelope (BOE) analysis 
● ﬁ nancial viability 
● affordable housing 
● ﬁ nanci ng sources 
● development scenarios 
● presenting a proposal 
COURSE MATERIALS  ASSIGNMENTS 
Columbia University’s online Courseworks system will be used for posting and updating the course outline and syllabus on a regular basis, as well as for weekly announcements by the Teaching Assistant or instructors. All course materials - such as readings, supplemental materials and assignments - will be posted, linked and accessible online on Courseworks approximately one week in advance of the class date. Students will be expected to review the assigned course materials in advance of each class and to be prepared to discuss including bringing any questions raised to the next lab or lecture.
All assignments will be posted on Courseworks roughly one week in advance of their due date. Completion of assignments in a timely manner is a critical component of the course as many assignments will build upon students’ previously completed and graded work.
All assignments for this class are individual assignments (unless speciﬁcally stated otherwise in the assignment prompt). Students are required to work independently to complete assigned work.
